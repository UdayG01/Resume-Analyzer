## üåü Project Overview

Resume Analyzer is a tool designed to process PDF resumes, extract relevant information, and score them based on specific criteria using AI models. It helps in evaluating candidates efficiently by automating the resume screening process.

## üì• Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ResumeAnalyzer.git
   cd ResumeAnalyzer
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Mistral API key:
   ```
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

### Extract Data from Resumes
1. Place PDF resumes in the `input_resumes` directory.
2. Run the data extraction script:
   ```bash
   python src/extract_data_v2.py
   ```
3. Run the scoring script:
    ```bash
    python src/scoring.py
    ```

### Process and Score Resumes
1. Run the main processing script:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
   This will process all resumes in the `input_resumes` directory, extract data, score them, and save the results to an Excel file in the `output_xl` directory.

### Parallel Processing
1. Run the threading script for faster processing:
   ```bash
   python src/main_threading.py
   ```

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Data Extraction**: Extracts key information from PDF resumes.
- **AI Scoring**: Scores resumes based on Generative AI and AI/ML experience.
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes multiple resumes simultaneously for faster execution.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates detailed Excel reports with extracted data and scores.
